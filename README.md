### Hi there, I'm Lilian 👋

● I have 6ish years of hands-on experience in industrial Enterprise Application Development, specializing in Data Application Development, Big Data Development, and Machine Learning Development.

● From 2016 to 2021, I collaborated in small to mid-level multifunctional R&D teams, actively participating and gaining hands-on experience in DataOps (data ingestion, data processing/data batch job/ETL, quality assurance, data modeling, data visualization, database interactions, data migration), DevOps, CICD, MLOps.

● My development journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of the entire Software Development Lifecycle, Agile Methodologies, Microservices Development Methodologies.

🏅 From 2017 to 2019, I refactored 7 enterprise web applications, saving $1.2 million for an internal enterprise web platform hosting 12 applications at MathArt Software Co., Ltd (a startup with 200+ staff). 

🏅 I served as a lead developer in two traditional machine-learning projects, with one achieving significant breakthroughs in compressor development and earning the third prize in the Shanghai Electric Intelligent Manufacturing AI Competition (2020 "上海电气杯" 工业APP), out of 2,000+ entries. 

⭐️As an enthusiastic learner and a software developer, I embrace emerging technologies and methodologies, seamlessly integrating cutting-edge solutions into my work with adaptability and innovation.

⭐️ My professional skills include:

➡️ Programming & Scripting Languages: Java, Python, R; SQL, PL/SQL, CQL; Javascript; Shell.

➡️ Web Development: Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud; Flask; HTML/CSS, React; RESTful API.

➡️ Database:
     ● Relational Databases/SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, SQLite.
     ● Non-Relational Databases/NoSQL: Redis, Apache Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB.
     ● DBaaS: Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, IBM Cloudant.

➡️ Hands-on Practice in Big Data Technologies & Development:
     ● SQL and Query Optimization
     ● Experience designing, testing, optimizing, and troubleshooting ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) solutions;
    ● Hands-on practice with Hadoop ecosystem, Spark ecosystem

📣 I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my professional skills and expertise. If you are looking for a dedicated professional who is passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies, I would be delighted to connect and discuss potential collaborations.
